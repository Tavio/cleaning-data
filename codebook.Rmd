The data
========================================================
The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for an experiment regarding wearable computing, and is obtainable from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. More information regarding this data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured. The experiments have been labelled manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The following files from the dataset are relevant for our analysis:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- 'test/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Tidying up the data
========================================================
The run_analysis.R script tidies up the data by performing the following steps in order:

1. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
2. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
4. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of the script is a clean data set that is written to a file called summarized_dataset.txt in the same directory as the run_analysis.R script.
